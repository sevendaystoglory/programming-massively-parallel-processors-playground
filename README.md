cuda-c will no longer be a blackbox. 

i am following the book https://edoras.sdsu.edu/~mthomas/docs/cuda/cuda_by_example.book.pdf (2010) for concepts and https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/pdf/CUDA_C_Programming_Guide.pdf (2025) for implementation pov 

1. playground has some scripts/demos
2. condensed-non-trivial-knowledge has some of my personal takeaways from certain sections of the book
